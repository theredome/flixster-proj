### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics helped me understand some of the core setup compenents in the project and being able to get it started and run properly in the beginning.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would find a way to get youtube videos to play without having to be clicked then I would also add a seperate link to set it up to foward you to a priate site so you can watch the movie actually. I'd also adjust the page so there's an actual home page that has recommend and top movies and you can side tab to search for more.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Most went as planned, I saw my peer had vids so I got that in after the demo, what I didn't add was the media query to check your preference (light or dark mode) and adjust the sight to that perferance.
